# DataScienceNanodegree
This repository contains the solutions to projects done for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree in order to learn and understand the concepts of Data Science Lifecycle.


# Project Overview

### 1. Data Science Blog Post

### 2. Disaster Response Pipeline
Target of this project was to build a Web App with a Machine Learning Pipeline in the backend to classify messages in 36 different categories. The web interface allowed users inputs, as free text messages. Based on the developed Machine Learning Pipeline the message was classified and a visual representation ist shown.


### 3. Data Science Capstone Project
In this project Pyspark on a Spark Cluster was used to build a churn predition system based on Sparkify customer data. Sparkify is a online music streaming company, which has a high interest to predict based on customer behaviour on the website if a user will churn or not.
The project involved:
- Loading and cleaning a small subset (128MB) of a full dataset available (12GB)
- Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and what features are useful for predicting churn
- Feature Engineering to create features that will be used in the modelling process
- Modelling using machine learning algorithms such as ....
