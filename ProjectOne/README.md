## Project Motivation

For this project I conducted an expoloratory data analysis 


With this analysis I want to answer the following questions:
- Which is the country with the hightest job satisfaction for developers?
- How does the salary between people who contribute to Open Source development differ to non-contributers?
- How does the job satisfaction differ between developers whose undergraduate major is IT-related and those who are not?
